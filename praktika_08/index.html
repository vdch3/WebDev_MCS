                        <p class="paragraphStyle">The Clover Club Cocktail is truly magnificient cocktail. This drink has all elements of great classic cocktail – the interesting story, simple and elegant composition and it is almost forgotten.
                            <br>
                            This cocktail was created (as Albert Stevens Crockett specify in his Old Waldorf Bar Days (1931) or The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book (1935) in the early 20th century in the bar of the Bellevue-Statford Hotel, Philadelphia which hosted Clover Club – the community of the lawyers and writers from Philadelphia.
                            <br>
                            Common recipe of Clover Club Cocktail include gin, lemon or lime juice, grenadine or raspberry syrup and egg white. Sometimes addition of the sweet vermouth or fresh raspberries is recomended. The Clover Club Cocktail has no garnish. If you garnish this drink with three mint leaf it morph into Clover Leaf Cocktail.

                        <p class="paragraphStyle">The Martinez Cocktail is a very old cocktail. Some peoples think that the Martinez is the precursor of the most famous cocktail of the world – The Martini Cocktail. The author of the Martinez Cocktail is legendary Jerry ‘Professor’ Thomas.
                            <br>
                            Some imbibers-bloggers pay attention for this cocktail too. You can find more interesting information about Martinez on the one of my favorite blog Oh, Gosh! (by Jay Hapburn) and, of course, on wonderful Spirits And Cocktails (by Jamie Boudreau).
                            <br>
                            First I’ve discovered an old-style version of the Martinez Cocktail, which is closer to the original recipe by Jerry Thomas.

                        <br>
                        <p class="paragraphStyle">The Bee’s Knees Cocktail is real Prohibition cocktail. The honey was great choice for masking awful smell and taste of bathtub gin. But in other side honey is very interesting natural ingredient with a lot of worth.
                            <br>
                            Actually the Bee’s Knees Cocktail is a wonderfull drink. It has so sweet and aromatic taste with pleasnt palate of gin and honey. Admirable!
